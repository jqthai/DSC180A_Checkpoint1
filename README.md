Checkpoint Repository for DSC180A Section A16

This checkpoint explores different graph neural networks and their performance on both node classification and graph classification on the CORA and IMDB-BINARY Datasets provided by pytorch geometric.

The required packages include pytorch geometric.

To access and store the datasets, simply look at the code files as they are directly imported from the torch geometric datasets.
